This is a sniffing module written in Python and it was used for the research of VoIP security.<br>
The paper describing this research is available here:

   > **Abstract** <br>
   > *Recently, VoIP technology is widely used in our daily life. Even VoIP has become a
technology that can be easily accessed from services such as home phone as well as
KakaoTalk.[1] Most of these Internet telephones use the RTP protocol. However, there is a
vulnerability that the audio data of users can be intercepted through packet sniffing in the
RTP protocol. So we want to create a tool to check the security level of a VoIP network
using the RTP protocol. To do so, we capture data packet from and to these VoIP networks.
For this purpose, we first configure a virtual VoIP network using Raspberry Pi and show the
security vulnerability by applying our developed sniffing tool to the VoIP network. We will
then analyze the captured packets and extract meaningful information from the analyzed
data using the Google Speech API. Finally, we will address the causes of these vulnerabilities
and possible solutions to address them.* <br>
